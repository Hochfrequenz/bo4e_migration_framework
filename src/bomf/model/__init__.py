    A business object relation describes the relation between two business object.
    E.g. a relation could have the type "has_melo" where relation_part_a is a bo4e.bo.Vertrag

    The relation type describes how two business objects relate to each other.
    This is not (only) about cardinality. It's about being able to model different relations between objects.
    Think about e.g. a business partner and an address: The relation could be:
    - the address is the residential address of the business partner
    - the address is the invoice address of the business partner
    - the address is the place where the business partner was born
    All these relation types are 1:1 relations between business partners and adresses, yet they all carry different
